# Multivatiate analysis of factors contributing to the end of the 2022 Mpox outbreak in Germany

This repository contains the R code that i used for my Bachelor Thesis Project at the Freie Universität Berlin.
I conducted an Elastic Net Regression on questionaire data to identify factors such as behavioral modifications that might have played a role in the end of the 2022 Mpox outbreak in Germany.
Analysis of the data and visualization of the results were conducted as shown in `mpox_BA.R`.

Unfortunately I am unable to make the analyzed data accessible through this repositpry due to privacy concerns.
